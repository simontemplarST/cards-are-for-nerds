It\u0026rsquo;s not impossible. Big tech has made the journey impractical. To do anything online nowadays you need to have a Paypal, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft account. Paypal to make any online payments with relative ease, Facebook to verify you are an actual person with profile age detection, Google for password-less authentication, and Microsoft because your Operating system requires you to share your identity to further track you. Why is that? To provide a convenient way to log in? Or could it be security? It is both of those things, but it is also a couple other things. Retention of attention, vendor lockdown, and using the customer as a revenue source. Most services I pay for are to keep my data seperate from the data I choose to put on \u0026ldquo;gratis\u0026rdquo; platforms. I choose to have 100 terabytes in my basement homelab to store my photos and precious memories instead of Google Photos or iCloud Photos.\nThis choice is definetely NOT Gratis. But it is Libre. Not because I think there are monsterous powers that are targeting me individually. But because I know that there are faults in even the best security models. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying mine is any better than Facebook, or Amazon\u0026rsquo;s storage solutions. But it is under my control, so if anything were to happen to it, it would be on me, nobody else. Sure I back up off site. But it sits in encrypted shards on those two backup providers. I\u0026rsquo;m a huge self hosted proponent for anyone that is relatively nerdy, (Funny because this is on a hosted provider. But I pay them and they\u0026rsquo;re a cool hosting company with good ethics).\nWhat do you host yourself? # Well locally:\nMesh Central Trillium Notes (Looking into Joplin or something Similar) Pi-hole DNS ARRR Stack NZBGet Sonarr Radarr Plex IceCast server (Art Bell Live) YuNohost for testing some cool apps. FreshRSS RSS-Bridge Uptime Kuma Mumble NextCloud for Photo backups and \u0026ldquo;Google Drive\u0026rdquo; like functions. In the Cloud? HRCC.wiki Minecraft server MVS3.8 mainframe emulator Cronicle (Over four servers two local and two in the cloud) #Why? It\u0026rsquo;s like gaming to me. I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked the idea of technological self-reliance. It\u0026rsquo;s just another hobby to fulfil my pedantic nature. It\u0026rsquo;s the same reason I like Ham Radio. Self hosted and self supported communications. It\u0026rsquo;s also great for learning while actively working. I have a more than full time job professionally, and have a family. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been great at sitting in a class and memorizing things. I learned more about math in Wood Shop than I did in a class room. I learned more about manufacturing engineering while at my previous job as a production manager. I learned more about IT while being an MSP for small insurance agencies than I would have in a class room. You get the point. I\u0026rsquo;m a hands on learner.\nMuch like you gaining experience in gaming, fishing, golfing, by practicing. I and many other people wanted to learn how tech worked. So we started self hosting our own things. Degoogling has just been a weird side effect. It\u0026rsquo;s not a hobby for everyone. It is one for a lot of people though. I\u0026rsquo;m working on getting my own family (Small Business Owner) to start self hosting some things because in their usecase, with relibality and cost in mind itmakes sense to do so.\n","date":"30 April 2023","permalink":"/posts/why-i-self-host/","section":"Posts","summary":"Have you ever ventured into the rabbit hole of de-bigTech\u0026rsquo;ing your life?","title":"Why I Selfhost"},{"content":"Where I have worked # Tandem Products - 6y8m - Production Supervisor and resident nerd that kept the network going\nHormel Foods Corporation - Oct \u0026lsquo;21 - Present - Official Title is IT Operations / Datacenter Technician. In reality, I am a systems engineer without the engineer title. I take on many side projects because I have a deep passion for learning.\nEducation # Self Taught / On the job training.\nExperience # SOC / Disaster Recovery lead Multiple Disaster Recovery situations due to extreme weather, unplanned power / WAN downtime. Cloud outages. Mainframe Enterprise Scheduling Worked with our Systems Programmers and analysts to tune the system for tight scheduling creating on time reporting, sales forcasting, and data transformations. vSphere cluster management 6,500 Virtual machines across the globe on 1,500 hypervisors L1|L2|L3 enterprise support In Operations, we are in a limbo spot, depending on the situation at hand, we are either Level one helpdesk support, or a Mainframe Systems programmer / Oracle Cloud Integrations specialist. I have dealt with all levels of support, triaging network issues, system failures, large scale damage assessment due to weather events, even hot fixing JCL to keep the business running. Front Line Cyber Security management Operations is also responsible for the front line Cyber Security management. In addition to our agent based IDS, we monitor the network for unfavorable traffic, and browsing behavior, incoming emails, suspicious SAN browsing, and attempts to gain access to restricted systems. Linux System Administration - 10yr This is more of a side passion. I ran a Minecraft Hosting platform for a few years until I eventually sold it to a larger player as they could take my customers and provide a better service. Enterprise Windows System Administration - 5yr In additon to my nearly two years with my current employer, I helped transition my high school from a Mac dominant environment to a Windows environment so we were able to be integrated to the Education Consortium we were in the process of joining. MacOS System Administration - 3yr I helped our school IT Administrator (Who also happened to be our Shop Teacher, sub math teacher, and Driver\u0026rsquo;s Ed instructor) manage our Mac environment since he was wearing multiple hats and I was willing to learn. Managed Service Provider for multiple local Insurance agencies. It started when my friend became an insurance producer, the office he was working at was woefully outdated and in need of a fully managed network with lifecycle management, agent based RMM/MDM. I have expanded into offering break fix for another agency. Microsoft Dynamics - 3yr As a Production Supervisor, I used Dynamics in a Supply chain role. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure - 2yr Ask for details (GovCon) Broadcom ESP workload director (DE and WA) - 2yr Ask for Details (GovCon) Tableau - 1yr I have created business processes for end users to get used to the Tableau workflow when they are at an entry level position. Informatica - 1yr I work with our applications analysts to troubleshoot Informatica workflows, and create some of my own on the side to gain experience. IBM i system operations - 2yr Operations is responsible for the user management, monitoring, job processing, and uptime of our IBM i environment, which consists of 35 production IBM i servers, 35 HA servers, and 3 development / testing servers. IBM z/OS adminstration - 6mo Our System programmer recently retired and I have taken on an unofficial role as an administrator, as I picked up how z/OS works pretty quickly. SOX Auditing written multiple SOX compliance SOP\u0026rsquo;s Created business processes that make it easier for a SOX auditor to do audits. Personality traits and Cultural beliefs # Openly Autistic.\nI have a deep passion for knowledge in general. That\u0026rsquo;s just how I am. I like knowing things. Anything relating to computers has been my hyper fixation for 20+ years. I like learning esoteric systems and \u0026ldquo;home rolled\u0026rdquo; solutions, because it gives you a better appreciation and understanding of industry standard systems.\nI believe in a work culture where all employees try to help others be the best they can be, while striving to be the best they can be. Being community oriented is important in a field such as IT. I have been woken up many a night because an IPL, or Database backup went sideways, and I logged on at 3AM to 6AM to get things back online, while having to work at 6 for my day.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a believer in documentation. Tribal knowledge is not a best practice in an ever expanding field. The Bus Factor is real. Having documentation that\u0026rsquo;s clear, accurate, and actually helpful has become my current priority over the last few months.

Speedo: A tool I wrote to take an hourly speedtest.net and DSLreports.com speed test, and puts them in a LibreOffice spreadsheet to give me daily averages in charts for Latency, and bandwidth throughput. All of this is tied to the internet via a multi-NIC machine running PFSense. It\u0026rsquo;s a lack luster set up as my network is small. But the best feature allows me to wireguard VPN into my house so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to expose any ports aside from two UDP ports. One for the Linode tunnel, and one for the Direct connection.\nHRCC WIKI # HRCC.WIKI\nThe other moderators of Ham Radio Crash Course and I started the Ham Radio Crash Course Wiki, (Still a work in Progress as we all have full time + jobs and limited free time as it is) It\u0026rsquo;s a central repository that will have a large base of knowledge for all things Ham Radio. This started due to us needing a centralized resource that wasnt tied to any resources we lacked full control over. the reason we chose Wiki.js as the platform is due to it\u0026rsquo;s more modern interface compared to MediaWiki, ease of install / configuration, and it\u0026rsquo;s portability to any other Wiki platform due to the use of Markdown as the source material.\nArt Bell Live # ARTBELLLIVE.COM\nI have insomnia. This radio program (Coast To Coast AM) talks about the parannormal, and spooky things of the world. I wrote up a 90\u0026rsquo;s esque site, and offer a radio stream for other insomniacs. Almost 10k views. Kinda cool. It uses Icecast on the backend for the audio stream. I have spent years finding, buying tapes of the shows and digitizing them for listening. This also simulcasts on a Part 15 certified FM transmitter at my house So I can set a sleep timer on my alarm clock radio and listen to it as I fall asleep without headphones or network connected gear.\nThe Spoop # THESPOOP.SUBSTACK.COM\nI have decided to culminate a few stories I see every day, save them to the Wayback Machine and then share them to readers.
