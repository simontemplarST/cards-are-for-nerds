# Personality traits and Cultural beliefs
- Openly Autistic. 

- I have a deep passion for knowledge in general. That's just how I am. I like knowing things. 
Anything relating to computers has been my hyper fixation for 20+ years. I like learning esoteric systems and "home rolled" solutions, because it gives you a better appreciation and understanding of industry standard systems.

- I believe in a work culture where all employees try to help others be the best they can be, while striving to be the best they can be. Being community oriented is important in a field such as IT. I have been woken up many a night because an IPL, or Database backup went sideways, and I logged on at 3AM to 6AM to get things back online, while having to work at 6 for my day. 

- I'm a believer in documentation. Tribal knowledge is not a best practice in an ever expanding field. The Bus Factor is real. Having documentation that's clear, accurate, and actually helpful has become my current priority over the last few months.
